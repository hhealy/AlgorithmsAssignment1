My assignment asks the user to enter in a prefix which runs through the BruteAutcomplete method. 
It scans through a list of 10,000 words, each of which has a designated weight, in an arraylist.
The user enters the prefix that they would like to search for
They then enter the number of results they'd like and it's outputted to the console.
